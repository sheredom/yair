**Y**et **A**nother **I**ntermediate **R**epresentation (pronounced Ya! IR) is a compiler intermediate representation written entirely in Rust. Key design decisions make the representation unique:

- No Î¦ (phi) nodes, basic blocks take arguments instead [\[1\]](#References-1).
- Target agnostic representation for de-coupling of components.
- Strong seperation between library components (you don't need to build, link, or use components you don't need).

## TODOs

- Add constants to the .ya files.
- Add a verifier.
- Add a cranelift code generation library.
- Add an optimizer!
